# Project of custom layout for my ferris sweep

First tests with the [default layout](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/ferris/keymaps/default) were only okayish:
* I don't manage to get used to the home-row mode, like shifting and changing layer accidentally
* I've get used to my custom work environment and shortcuts.

After a small research, nothing like a popular laout or established standard popped out (except designing custom layout). So here is yet another custom layout project.

# Goals

* Basic alpha and punctuation
* Easy access to symbols for development
* Compatibility with (POSIX) command line shells
* Extended special characters and diacritics
* Shortcut for virtual desktops
